# Chromatography_Simulation_Python
Finite Difference Solver for Chromatography Equations

This project offers functions and an example to simulate chromatography of multiple components using a transport dispersive model and supports Hery, Langmuir and SMA as isotherm models for the component.
A one dimensional finite difference euler foward method was used using numpy for faster computations and matplotlib for visualization. As boundary conditions dirichlet at the inlet and neumann at the outlet was used for the concentration
